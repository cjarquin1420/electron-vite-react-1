## 🚨 Be aware

This template integrates Node.js API to the renderer process by default. If you want to follow **Electron Security Concerns** you might want to disable this feature. You will have to expose needed API by yourself.  

To get started, remove the option as shown below. This will [modify the Vite configuration and disable this feature](https://github.com/electron-vite/vite-plugin-electron-renderer#config-presets-opinionated).
